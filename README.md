# Airbnb Dynamic Price Recommendation

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **dynamic pricing recommendation system for Airbnb listings** using data analysis and visualization. The aim is to help hosts optimize their pricing strategies based on **location, property type, reviews, and seasonal demand**.

We used:

* **Python** â†’ for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* **Excel** â†’ for structured dataset management and basic transformations
* **Tableau** â†’ for creating an interactive dashboard to visualize insights and trends

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection

* Airbnb dataset containing details such as host ID, neighbourhood, room type, price, number of reviews, and availability.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)

* Handled **missing values** and removed duplicates.
* Normalized pricing data (removed outliers with extremely high/low values).
* Converted date and categorical fields into structured formats.
* Generated new features like **average price per neighbourhood group**, **reviews per month**, and **host activity level**.

### 3. Data Transformation (Excel)

* Aggregated neighborhood-level data for comparison.
* Created summary tables for **neighbourhood vs price**, **room type vs price**, and **reviews trend**.
* Exported structured datasets for dashboard integration.

### 4. Data Visualization (Tableau)

We built an **interactive dashboard** showcasing:

* **Average price by neighbourhood and room type**
* **Top hosts by reviews and pricing strategy**
* **Review trends over years/months**
* **Geospatial mapping of listings across NYC**
* **Demand & pricing heatmaps** for better comparison

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

* **Manhattan** has the highest average price (\~\$197), followed by **Brooklyn (\~\$124)**.
* **Brooklyn (41.1%)** and **Manhattan (44.3%)** dominate the Airbnb market share in NYC.
* Most reviews are concentrated between **2016-2019**, showing Airbnbâ€™s rapid growth.
* Seasonal demand is highest during **summer months (June-July)**.
* Entire home/apartment listings receive more reviews compared to private/shared rooms.

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendation System Logic

Our **dynamic pricing recommendation model** considers:

1. **Location (neighbourhood group & micro-neighbourhoods)**
2. **Room type (entire home/apt, private, shared)**
3. **Review frequency & demand trends**
4. **Seasonal variation (monthly bookings/reviews)**

âž¡ Hosts are advised to:

* Increase prices during **peak seasons (summer, holidays)**.
* Offer **competitive discounts** in low-demand months to attract bookings.
* Use **location-specific benchmarks** (e.g., listings in Queens priced competitively at \~\$99).

## ðŸ“Œ Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) â€“ data cleaning & analysis
* **Excel** â€“ dataset structuring & aggregation
* **Tableau** â€“ interactive dashboard visualization

---

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

* Build a **machine learning model** for price prediction.
* Incorporate **real-time Airbnb API data** for live recommendations.
* Add **sentiment analysis** on guest reviews to improve price adjustments.
